# Diabetes-classification

Two different modelling approaches for a machine learning task for the diabetes dataset.

Both shallow learners like Linear regression, Decision trees, Gradient boosting, and SVG tested with hyperparameter tuning, and neural network model tested with manual parameter changes for learning rate, batch size, dropout, normalisation etc., adjusted in order to find the best performance.

Conclusion: Shallow learners performed as well as the Neural network model.
